## About me
Welcome to my personal website! I'm originally from in Davis, California, indeed home to many cows, sheep (iykyk), and a very tiny dowtown. I moved to the Bay Area for college at UC Berkeley, where I fully nerded-out and majored in physics! I am deeply thankful to be a rising fourth-year medical student at UCLA, currently doing full-time research in computer vision in medical imaging!

I am proudly queer, gender non-binary (they/them pronouns, please!), and first-generation Chinese-American. I spend most of my free time climbing both indoors and out! I also enjoy string music (was a member of the University Baroque Ensemble in college!) and doing anything with friends!
