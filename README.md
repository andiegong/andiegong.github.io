## About me
Welcome to my personal website! I'm originally from Davis, California and I studied physics at UC Berkeley, where I made lifelong friendships and became the human I am today. I am a fourth-year medical student at UCLA and I am persuing a career in Diagnoistic Radiology! I have the deepest gratitude for the opportunities to work with the [UCLA Center for Computer Vision and Imaging Biomarkers](https://cvib.ucla.edu/), where I have been exploring my interests in oncologic imaging, medical physics, and computational research.

I am proudly queer, transgender (they/them pronouns, please!), and first-generation Chinese-American. I spend most of my free time climbing, both indoors and out. I also enjoy string music and was a member of the [University Baroque Ensemble](https://music.berkeley.edu/performance-opportunities/university-baroque-ensemble/) throughout all years in college.
